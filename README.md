# Face-Generation

These files are my solutions for the fifth and final project of Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation course. The objective was to generate new human faces from random noise after unsupervised training on a large dataset (200,000 images) of celebrity faces. To achieve this goal I used the Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) architecture.

Python and Tensorflow were used to program and model the network. The code is included in dlnd_face_generation.ipynb.
